## About the Video Course
We're living in a world of multiple screens. On a typical day you might view the screen on your mobile device, your tablet, your television and desktop computer at work. Designing content that works on all size screens and optimizing for mobile previously meant writing multiple versions of your application. However, those days are over. Today, with a good understanding of HTML you can write your code so that it works on every size screen while taking advantage of the unique environment afforded by mobile. This course will show you how. It's no longer enough to write HTML5 that doesn't go everywhere customers do. Increasingly, your customers are more and more mobile and your HTML5 has to have the flexibility to be displayed on any screen and the features to take advantage of the mobile ecosystem. This course is for you if you know a bit of HTML and are looking to expand your skills in to the mobile realm. If you're a web designer or developer trying to expand your work beyond the desktop you're going to truly benefit from this excellent course.
